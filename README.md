# signature-extraction-pan
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution to automatically extract signatures from PAN (Permanent Account Number) cards. The process involves utilizing image processing techniques and machine learning models to locate, isolate, and extract the signature area from scanned or photographed PAN cards.
# Introduction
PAN cards are essential identification documents issued by the Indian government for taxpayers. One of the crucial components of a PAN card is the signature of the cardholder. This project focuses on automating the process of extracting signatures from PAN cards using machine learning techniques. The extracted signature can be used for verification, authentication, and various financial transactions.

# Project Overview
The project involves several stages, including data collection, preprocessing, training a machine learning model, and developing an extraction mechanism. The extracted signatures are then evaluated for accuracy and quality.
# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is not provided in this repository due to privacy and licensing concerns. You should prepare a dataset of PAN card images with annotated signature regions. The annotations should be in the form of bounding boxes around the signatures.

# Model
The signature extraction model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The architecture includes several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. Transfer learning using pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG can also be explored.
